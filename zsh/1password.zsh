# 1Password CLI integration
#

# Setup 1Password CLI shell plugin integration using functions instead of
# aliases. This is necessary for shell completion to work correctly with aliases
# to commands which have 1Password integration enabled.
#
# This function a hacky-ish workaround to the issue described here:
# https://github.com/1Password/shell-plugins/issues/433
#
# It loads the 1Password CLI plugin script file, then finds all aliases that are
# 1Password shell plugin aliases and converts them to functions. The functions
# are then stored in a cache file, which is sourced every time the shell is
# started.
#
# The cache file is only updated if the plugins script file is newer than the
# cache file. This is to prevent the cache file from being updated every time
# the shell is started.
#
# To use this function, simply call it once during shell startup, and it will
# take care of the rest.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1: The script file containing the 1Password CLI plugin aliases. Default is
#       $HOME/.config/op/plugins.sh.
#   $2: The cache file to store the converted functions. Default is
#       $HOME/.config/op/plugins_as_functions.cache.sh.
