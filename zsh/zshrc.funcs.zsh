# setup-completions is a helper function to set up shell completions for a given
# command. It generates Zsh completion scripts and places them in the specified
# completions directory. If the completion file already exists, it checks if the
# source file has been updated and regenerates the completions if necessary.
#
# Arguments:
#
#   $1 - cmd:         The name of the command for which completions are being
#                     set up.
#   $2 - source:      The source file used to determine if completions need to
#                     be re-generated. For example, the binary file of the
#                     command (e.g., rustup).
#   $@ - args:        The command to run to generate the completions. This
#                     should produce Zsh completion scripts.
#
# Example usage:
#
#     setup-completions rustup "$(command -v rustup)" rustup completions zsh
#
# This example sets up completions for the 'rustup' command by running
# 'rustup completions zsh', and places the generated completion script in the
# appropriate completions directory. If the source file is newer than the target
# completion file, the command is re-executed and the completion script is
# updated.
#
# The completions are placed in the directory specified by the ZSH_COMPLETIONS
# environment variable. If ZSH_COMPLETIONS is not set, the completions are
# placed in $HOME/.zsh/completions by default.

# Example:
#   alias brew="op plugin run -- brew"
#   convert_alias_to_function "$(alias brew)"

#   unalias brew
#   brew() {
#     op plugin run -- brew "$@"

# Example:
#   alias brew="op plugin run -- brew"
