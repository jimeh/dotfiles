--- A Hammerspoon module for toggling between specified applications using

---
--- This module allows you to bind a hotkey to switch focus between specific
--- applications and show/hide them.

--- app_toggle:bind(mods, key, ...)
--- Method
--- Binds a hotkey to toggle between the specified applications.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table with the modifiers for the hotkey
---  * key - A string with the key for the hotkey
---  * ... - A list of tables, each containing an application name and an
---          optional path
function obj:bind(mods, key, ...)
  local apps = { ... }
  if #apps > 1 then
    self:start()

  hs.hotkey.bind(mods, key, self:toggleFn(apps))
end

--- app_toggle:toggleFn(apps)
--- Method
--- Creates and returns a function that toggles between the specified
--- applications via app_toggle:toggle() when called.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * apps - A table containing application configurations. Each configuration
---           is a table with an application name at the first index and an
---           optional path at the second index.
---
--- Returns:
---  * A function that, when called, toggles between the specified applications.
---
--- Example:
---  local toggleApps = obj:toggleFn({{"Firefox"}, {"Safari"}})
---  hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "ctrl"}, "b", toggleApps)
---
--- Notes:
---  * The returned function can be used as a callback for hotkey bindings or
---    other event-driven scenarios.
function obj:toggleFn(apps)
  return function()
    self:toggle(apps)
  end
end

--- app_toggle:toggle(apps)
--- Method
--- Toggles focus/visibility specified applications.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * apps - A table containing application configurations. Each configuration
---           is a table with an application name at the first index and an
---           optional path at the second index.
---
--- Notes:
---  * If none of the specified applications are running, the function attempts
---    to launch the first application in the list.
---  * If the most recently focused application in the list is the current
---    frontmost application, it will be hidden. Otherwise, the most recently
---    focused application will be brought to the front.
